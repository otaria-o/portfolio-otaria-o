            I grew up in Italy, close to Milan, and wanted to be a dancer.
            {/* <br />I have a Master's degree in Sociology and have recently
            completed an intensive Web Developer Full Stack bootcamp. I have */}
            <br />I worked in different fields: I have been a secretary, a
            social worker, a cashier and a bookseller.
            <br />I live with my husband and my daughter in Berlin. I like
            baking bread and cookies. I also enjoy going for walks, along the
            Spree and in the Tiergarten, sitting in a caf√© and looking around,
            listening to my thoughts or to people's conversations. <br />I am
            passionate about books, especially picture books, and also poetry.
